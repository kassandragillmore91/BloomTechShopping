     We will break down the project into reasonable sized tasks, making sure each team member
  has an even amount of work to do and doing code reviews within the team.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
    Figure out what went wrong so that we don't make the same mistake again and acknowledge to 
    the others that you missed it so that it can be completed.

     We are using Trello to keep goals and tasks clear and so that each team member knows
    our expectations.
