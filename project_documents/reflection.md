# [Team name] Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder *

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 

We feel like we followed our design doc fairly closely, the biggest changes we made 
were to the API endpoints.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
    - asking for help, taking a break and coming back later
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
    
## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
    - keeping track of what everyone was working on daily, so we didn't work over each other was helpful

* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
    - K definitely overestimated the time it take to learn react

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
    - asking for help earlier instead of wasting lots of time trying to figure it out alone would have increased 
      productivity immensely
